## Availability

This role is designed for internal use but if useful can be shared publicly.

## Branches

This project uses three permanent branches with the *Git Flow* branching model managing the interaction between branches.

* **Develop:** unstable, potentially non-working but most current version of roles. Bug fixes and features interact with this branch only.
* **Master:** stable, tested, working version of role with full documentation. Releases and hot fixes mainly interact with this branch. This branch should when consuming roles internally.
* **Public:** equivalent to the *master* branch, but available externally. Some configuration details may be altered or features removed to make available for public release.

## Testing

Manual testing is performed for all roles to ensure roles achieve their aims and this forms a prerequisite task for merging changes into the *master* and *public* branches.
Wherever possible testing is as complete as possible meaning tasks such as downloading dependencies are performed as part of each test.

## Issues

Please log issues to the [BAS Web and Applications Team](https://jira.ceh.ac.uk/browse/BASWEB) project in Jira, within the *Project - Ansible Roles* component.
